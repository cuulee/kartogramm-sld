# kartogramm-sld
Here you can find GeoServer SLD styles for [Kartogramm](https://github.com/tkardi/kartogramm)
for creating raster map tiles. This repo includes all the essential files for hooking
this into an existing GeoServer `DATA_DIR`, and given the Kartogramm datasources
data pre-and-postprocessed will serve some maps in raster format.

## Available
`old` - [preview](https://tkardi.ee/old/map/?lon=26.352110211155075&lat=58.127027294465165&z=5).
This started out as an entry for 2020 #30DayMapChallenge day 17 theme _Old_
but gradually transformed into a monochromatic. The original idea was to
kind of replicate [this 1912 Tartu city plan](https://tartu1941.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/1912-plaan-2500.png).

`atlas` - [preview](https://tkardi.ee/atlas/map/?lon=25.105830396555543&lat=58.687847774228786&z=4).
This started out as an entry for 2020 #30DayMapChallenge day 30 theme _A map_
and is a shot at producing a _road-atlas-on-paper_ like look and feel.
